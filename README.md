### Front end

1. Fetch the items from the API. **Use the fetch library** (not axios).
1. Display the items in a grid. Make the grid responsive as best you can. Use a reusable **layout component** for the grid.
1. Display the item name, short description, image, price, and toppings. Here is an **example** screen shot. Feel free to make yours look better!

1. Display a loading UI while the call to your API is in progress. Here is an **example** screen shot. Feel free to make yours look better!

1. Handle any errors that are thrown by displaying them in the application. This includes **server errors** (non-2xx responses from your API) and **front end errors** (errors that are thrown in the front-end code). Here is an **example** screen shot. Feel free to make yours look better!
